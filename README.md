### About me

My name is Demian, I'm a 26yo soon-to-be statistician. I live in Porto Alegre - RS and study at UFRGS. For a short while I was a mechatronics technician and studied engineering, nowadays however, I work doing analytics at a fintech company. I have a lot of curiosity and enjoy learning different things; my main interests are:
- Statistical methods, bayesian stuff
- Some R tidyverse coding and whatnot
- Survey sampling
- A/B testing


Also I
- chose stats so I could play in everyone's backyard
- recreationally enjoy art, movies, games, [*gincanas*](https://www.instagram.com/equipetiaraju/)
- actually like spreadsheets
