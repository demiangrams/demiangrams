### About me

My name is Demian, I'm a 26yo soon-to-be statistician. I live in Porto Alegre - RS and study at UFRGS. For a short while I was a mechatronics technician and studied engineering, nowadays however, I work doing analytics at a fintech company. I have a lot of curiosity and enjoy learning different things; my main interests, somewhat ordered, are:
- Statistical methods, inference
- Experiments (A/B testing etc), a little bit of Causal ML
- Surveys, market research
- Some R tidyverse coding and whatnot

So in summary, I care about the best ML/statistical practices in order to make reasonable inferences.


Also I
- chose stats so I could play in everyone's backyard
- actually like spreadsheets
- recreationally enjoy art, movies, games, [*gincanas*](https://www.instagram.com/equipetiaraju/)
- have 10 tattoos, among them an Î©, a [Memento](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209144/) reference, and a Calvin and Hobbes panel
