### About me

My name is Demian, I'm a 27yo statistician, currently living in Porto Alegre - RS. For a short while I was a mechatronics technician and studied engineering, nowadays however, I work doing analytics at a fintech company. I have a lot of curiosity and enjoy learning different things. My main interests are:
- Statistical methods, inference, A/B testing...
- Some Python/R tidyverse coding, simulation
- Data visualization, applied math/modelling and whatnot


Also I
- chose stats so I could play in everyone's backyard
- recreationally enjoy art, movies, games, [*gincanas*](https://www.instagram.com/equipetiaraju/)
- have 10 tattoos, among them an Î©, a [Memento](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209144/) reference, and a Calvin and Hobbes panel
